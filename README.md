Examples using [Zephyr RTOS](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) on [ST STM32F429I Discovery](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f429idiscovery.html) board using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) IDE
=====================================

This repository contains examples of codes used in teaching, particularly at [ESIEA](https://www.esiea.fr/).

4 examples are proposed:
- [NoGUI](NoGUI/) - Using the 2 LEDs on the board and the button.
   - 3 tasks are created:
     - 1 task per LED with sporadic lighting (using k_msleep)
     - 1 task allowing lighting the 2 LEDs when the button has been pressed (using interruption).
  - [Un overlay](NoGUI/zephyr/boards/stm32f429i_disc1.overlay) is defined to show how to add the declaration of a new external LED, not used in the proposed code.
- [WithGUI](WithGUI/) - Using the board screen, touch interface, an image and an external sensor [BME680](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/gas-sensors/bme680/) connected in I2C.
Temperature and humidity values are added to a chart and regularly printed on the screen using labels.
  - Screen:
     - The [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) library is used, from the Zephyr framework.
     - The appropriate configuration is made in the [.conf](WithGUI/zephyr/prj.conf) file of the project, in particular to activate the management of:
       - DISPLAY
       - INPUT
       - LVGL and its components (buttons, charts, labels, etc.)
       - SENSORS and in particular the BME680 driver
     - The appropriate configuration is made in the [.conf](WithGUI/zephyr/boards/stm32f429i_disc1.conf) file of the board, in particular to activate the management of:
       - SPI and the ILI9340 driver used by the screen,
       - specific characteristics of the screen for LVGL (color)
       - I2C used by the BME680.
     - [An overlay](WithGUI/zephyr/boards/stm32f429i_disc1.overlay) is defined to specify that the BME680 is connected to **I2C 3** of the board, with address **0x77**.
- [PeriodicTasks](PeriodicTasks/) - Creation of 2 periodic tasks (using timers) with display on the LEDs integrated into the board and with a configurable duration (use of 'nop' to simulate the use of the processor).
- [Samples](Samples/) - No task used, only example using DISPLAY, INPUT, BME680 and ADC (:warning: only one channel is used on SMT32 and this version of Zephyr).
